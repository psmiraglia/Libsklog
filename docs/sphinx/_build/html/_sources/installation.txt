Installation
************

In this section is shown the procedure to install the library and to
configure the environment. All steps are described assuming that the
library installation prefix ($PREFIX) is::

   /usr/local


Get Sources and Install Library
===============================

Before proceeding with the installation, several dependencies need to 
be resolved:::

    Libtool
    Autoconf
    OpenSSL >= 0.9.8
    SQLite 3.x
    libuuid
    libconf
    libjansson

Get the sources from GitHub repository::

	mkdir ~/temp
	cd ~/temp
	git clone https://github.com/psmiraglia/Libsklog.git libsklog
	
Generate ./configure script (usually only the first time)::

	cd libsklog
	autoreconf --install --force --verbose
	
Run ./configure script using the option --enable-debug (strongly
recommended). Other options are available, to see them run::

	./configure --help
	
Build and install the library::

	./configure --enable-debug
	make
	make install (as root)
	
If you are Debian addicted, you can use "checkinstall" instead
of "make install". In this way a .deb package will be created and
installed.::

	./configure --enable-debug
	make
	checkinstall (as root)
