Welcome to Libsklog's documentation!
====================================

This is the documentation for Libsklog |release|, last updated |today|.

Introduction
------------

Libsklog is a C library which allows users to create logentries
according to the scheme defined by B. Schneier and J. Kelsey in 
`Secure Audit Logs to Support Computer Forensics`_. This document will
illustrate you about how to install the library under Linux systems,
how to configure the environment and finally how to use it.
